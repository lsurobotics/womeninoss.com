<p>Open-source software (OSS) thrives on collaboration and innovation, yet for many women, entering this space can feel like an uphill battle. With only 11% of OSS contributors being women — and even fewer in leadership roles — the gender gap is undeniable. A significant part of this issue stems from the challenges women face while contributing to open-source projects, many of which go unrecognized or unaddressed. By shedding light on these obstacles, we believe we can foster more inclusive environments, build confidence in newcomers, and increase women’s participation in OSS. This section reveals some challenges that women face in OSS.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="lack-of-peer-support">Lack of peer support</h2>
<p>Research has shown that a significant challenge for women contributing to OSS is the lack of peer parity, leading contributors to feel invisible in larger men-dominated groups (<a class="paper" target="__blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3510460?casa_token=Byrbr08Ixd0AAAAA%3AeYpmhNfBa0laTMBfKMPItVYE3Ecz7Lu2Wk2PvxmK1DumMQm1toYlm-glh8xHKwIcKsIqEoNOtOdD">Trinkenreich et al., 2022 ↗</a>). Without female mentors, many women struggle to find guidance, leading to isolation and, ultimately, disengagement. Expanding the presence of women in leadership and mentorship roles is essential to fostering a more inclusive and supportive environment. While such a problem is a work-in-progress, structured mentorship programs, like those offered by <a class="paper" target="__blank" href="https://www.outreachy.org/">Outreachy ↗</a> and <a class="paper" target="__blank" href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code ↗</a>, are great initiatives for those willing to particiapte in OSS communities. These programs provide practical advice and a clear path towards contributions.</p>

<p>However, don’t let this discourage you! If you’re eager to contribute to an OSS project, don’t let the potential lack of peer support hold you back. Research has also demonstrated that women play crucial roles, both as coders and non-coders, within OSS communities, with many serving as maintainers. Sharing success stories of women can inspire newcomers and increase visibility. If you know any active OSS contributors, invite them to share their experiences! Our website welcomes histories from OSS contributors.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-the-ball-rolling">Keeping the ball rolling</h2>
<p>Taking that first step in OSS is a complicated step for any newcomer. For women, the fear of judgment, the imposter syndrome, the lack of peer parity, and work-life balance issues can make the process even more complicated. We need to keep the ball rolling. OSS projects provide great learning experiences for women, allowing them to connect with the software industry and learn more about software development. To avoid frustration while contributing to OSS projects, a few strategies can be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Start with something simple</strong>: Always start with something simple. OSS projects usually categorize tasks that are suitable for newcomers with labels such as “good first issue” or “beginner friendly”.</li>
  <li><strong>Always contact the community</strong>: While women remain a minority in OSS, many contributors are eager to support newcomers. Don’t let the lack of peer parity discourage you from getting involved — your contributions are as valuable to the community as theirs.</li>
  <li><strong>Don’t let the imposter syndrome or fear of judgment dominate you</strong>: According to <a class="paper" target="__blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucianapaulise/2023/03/08/75-of-women-executives-experience-imposter-syndrome-in-the-workplace/">Forbes ↗</a>, 75% of women executives face imposter syndrome in their workspace. While such a feeling persists in most women, perseverance and courage are the keys. Don’t let the imposter syndrome of the fear of judgment dominate you. You are talented. You are qualified. You can do it.</li>
</ul>

<p>For those who are already part of OSS communities, the support of newcomers is essential. Don’t let newcomers give up on their contributions, and help them as much as possible.</p>

<h2 id="non-inclusive-environments">Non-inclusive environments</h2>
<p>Toxicity and negative behavior are unfortunately significant and present challenges women face in OSS communities. In a research survey (<a class="paper" target="__blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3510460?casa_token=Byrbr08Ixd0AAAAA%3AeYpmhNfBa0laTMBfKMPItVYE3Ecz7Lu2Wk2PvxmK1DumMQm1toYlm-glh8xHKwIcKsIqEoNOtOdD">Trinkenreich et al., 2022 ↗</a>), women involved in OSS reported the presence of gender bias, harassment, and exclusionary behavior in many OSS communities. From dismissive comments in technical discussions to outright harassment, these behaviors push many women out of this context. Even after contributing, women often face greater scrutiny compared to men. Occurrences connected to the ideas of <a class="paper" target="__blank" href="https://hbr.org/2015/03/the-5-biases-pushing-women-out-of-stem">“prove-it-again” ↗</a> and <a class="paper" target="__blank" href="https://eige.europa.eu/publications-resources/thesaurus/terms/1099?language_content_entity=en">“glass ceiling” ↗</a> force women to repeatedly demonstrate their competence, making the process of contributing to OSS exhausting and discouraging.</p>

<p>To foster positive experiences, we encourage women to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Contribute to communities that uphold a clear and enforceable code of conduct (e.g., <a class="paper" target="__blank" href="https://rubyonrails.org/conduct">Rails’s Code of Conduct ↗</a>).</li>
  <li>Engage with mentors that support and advocate for your contributions.</li>
  <li>Report any instances of toxicity or discrimination to project mantainers.</li>
  <li>Focus on projects with diverse leadership and a commitment to gender equity.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-challenges">Other challenges</h2>
<p>Besides gender-associated challenges, women also face the same challenges as any newcomer. Igor Steinmacher lists several of these barriers in his <a class="paper" target="__blank" href="https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/45/45134/tde-30112015-131552/publico/TeseSteinmacher.pdf">thesis ↗</a> “Supporting newcomers to overcome the barriers to contribute to open software projects”. Among the barriers most newcomers face, we find the following categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Personal barriers:</b> This includes fear of judgment, low confidence, and hesitation to ask for assistance.</li>
  <li><b>Interpersonal barriers:</b> Lack of response from mantainers, unwelcoming communities, and lack of documentation.</li>
  <li><b>Process barriers:</b> Lengthy contributions, unclear contribution guidelines, and difficulty in finding beginner-friendly tasks.</li>
  <li><b>Technical barriers:</b> Difficulties in setting up the project locally, high code complexity, and lack of background knowledge to start a contribution.</li>
</ul>

<p>While such barriers may exist, following our guidelines for getting started in an open-source project can help overcome these challenges. Don’t waste your time, read our <a class="paper" target="__blank" href="/posts/starting-in-oss.html">discussion ↗</a> on this topic.</p>
